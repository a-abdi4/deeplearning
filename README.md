# Pytorch - deeplearning/machine learning

- A torch.Tensor is a multi-dimentional matrix containing elements of a single data type
- similar to numpy arrays, but full of fun things that make them work better on GPUs(vs regular CPUs)

- default data type of float32
- more suitable for deeplearning than a numpy array
